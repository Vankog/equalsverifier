Thank you for taking the time to submit a pull request and trying to improve EqualsVerifier! I appreciate it!

Before you continue, please consider the following:

- Is your PR small, such as a small bug fix with test, or a typo fix? Awesome, thank you! I'll probably merge it right away.
- Is your PR large, such as a new feature? Please consider [submitting a feature request](https://github.com/jqno/equalsverifier/issues/new) first, so we can discuss what you're about to contribute. Perhaps a different approach fits better with EqualsVerifier's code base, or maybe a similar feature already exists. I would feel really bad if you spent all that effort on a PR if it's not a good fit for the project.
